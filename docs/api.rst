Python API
----------

BugZoo provides a powerful set of Python bindings for its RESTlike API. The
Python API is intended to be used as a library when building your own tools
(e.g., for program repair, mutation testing, and test generation), or for
simply when a better, well-structured means of interacting with historical
software bugs is needed to conduct an empirical study.
